        <h3>My name is Lee Running Crane, I'm 19, I'm a sophomore in Media Arts with a concentration in film.</h3>
        <br>
<h3> Right now, I'm working in the film equipment room in Mcgill. Back at home, in Browning MT, I have a big family that I love a lot, especially my mom and two little sisters, Ada and Layla, who are three and one. 
    Outside of school and work, I enjoy listening to music, going to punk shows, and going to the Roxy theater. After I graduate, I hope to become
a writer and dirctor.</h3>
